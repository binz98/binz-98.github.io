Welcome to Bin Zhang’s Personal Homepage!

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). My research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent System, and Large Language Model (LLM) Agents. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guoliang Fan](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~fanguoliang) of Complex Systems Cognition and Decision Making Lab.

In my doctoral studies, I have been investigating how to enable autonomous agents to learn and make decisions in complex, multi-agent environments. This includes developing new reinforcement learning algorithms that allow agents to cooperate, compete, and adapt in the face of uncertainty and partial information. 
% I have published more than 20 papers at the international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6Cqm0pYAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6Cqm0pYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

If you are interested with my experience or research. Plese feel free to contact with me! [Wechat](../images/wechat.jpg)
